# Bitmap Fonts

Collection of bitmap fonts originally drawn by me for use in my tech demo.

I originally had a README that had more information but Github Desktop destroyed it somehow. -_-

All these fonts are only using 1+2 colours (transparent + two levels of visible). The 4pt "Block" font also has a 1bpp version that doesn't look quite as nice.

Use however your like; I drew all of these from scratch (albeit with strong inspiration from *Crisis Core: FFVII* for the "Core" series) , so they are free to use.
